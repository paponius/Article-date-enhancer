# Article date enhancer

Adds information about news article date.

- Old article warning  
Yellow bar above article header saying the article is old.  
This feature is natively present on The Guardian.  
This script will show similar warning also for other sites.

- Local time  
Some outlets show publishing time using their headquarter time zone, some will recalculate to show local time zone of the device on which the article is read.  
This will change the time to local for all.

- Publish date including time, showing full date/time instead of "2 days ago", showing date of an update to the article content.

## Sites (so far)
nytimes.com  
cnn.com  
politico.eu  
politico.com  
reuters.com  
bbc.com  
bbc.co.uk  

All have **old article warning**, not all yet show **local time**, it's not possible for all to add **updated date**, some do show it natively.
